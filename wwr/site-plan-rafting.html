    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is to provide a thrilling ride to an experienced white water rafter and to provide an affordible ride to the newcomers
        who have never experienced white water rafting. we can achieve this by keeping the costs low for the people with little to no 
        experice and guiding them down a simple river while providing a high quality trip to those who have done it berfore. we will keep cost 
        low for the begginer experice and take them down very few tame rapids and as they gane more experience we will take them on longer and 
        more intese trips.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audiance are people who like to be outside and want to rafing. we need to keep in mind the new comers who have never gone before 
        so they don't know anything abour White Water Rafting, our font/colors/images should be simple but still portray the experience of
        rafting. the images should show some rapids that while big are not intense enough to scare people away. a lot of our demographic is aimed 
        to be newcomers no matter the age especially those in their 20s-30s who are looking for a fun experiece with either their family 
        or friends.
