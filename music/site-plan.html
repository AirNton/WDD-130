      <p>
        On this part of the website i would tak about my 10 favorite songs.
        i will go into detail on why i think these songs stand above all other songs in my opinion.
        I want this website to be fun to read and not some boring expostion about music so i want to add 
        a little humor with the songs. An example of a song i want to add to the add is Kickstart my Heart by
        Mötley Crüe and i want to talk about how you can feel the speeding tickets coming
        when you listen to it. somthing funny like that. I will talk about my favorite parts of these songs.

      </ul>
      <h3>Albums</h3>
      <p>
        This section is where I mention Albums instead of individual songs. This differs completly from songs.
        In this section I want to focus on Albums that tell a story and the music is consitantly good. I want to include Albums like Disease by Beartooth
        Or DAMN by Kendrick Lamar. I'm focuings this strictly on Albums in this part so I won't be talking about Songs as much but more about over arching themes.
        Such as in DAMN being a storyof how a person goes from being Prideful and Hateful to having to humble themsleves and eek out a differnt life. but played in reverse you get an Album about a Humble nice man that is corrupted by the world and eventually dies.
        I will point our specific songs in Albums that help drive home the points of the theme of the Album but i"m mostly going to focus on the message of the Album itslef.

      </ul>
      <h3>Artists</h3>
      <p>
        On this part i will talk about my favorte Artists. This will be very close with the Albums because most Artists who can write one good Album can make multilple but ill try to talk more about the Artists as people not about their music. And if i talk about their music it's going to be general tones and themes i like and not a single song or album written by the Artists themselves.
