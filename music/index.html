            <h1>About Me and my taste in Songs</h1>
            <p>I think that I have a pretty good taste in music. And I wanted to share my taste in songs as my website. As a disclosure this list is fact and while i will probably continue to update it only what I say is correct nobody else. This list is in no particular order it's just the songs, albums, and artists I like. Unfortunately A lot of the album covers are in fact copyrighted so I can't show them. So enjoy some of the images being pictures of the album covers, fan art, and images provided by Wikipedia all of them i only need to provide the link to the website where it's hosted to have given proper atribution. This goes for every page on this website.</p>

                <h1>21st Century Schizoid Man by King Crimson</h1>
                <p>21st Century Schiziod Man is a great Driving song to walk to. It's a longer song with very little lyrics. But it makes up for the great Jazz-Rock instrumentals in the song. The tempo and the intenseity of the song leaves nothing to be desired. I must admit when I first heard the song I was not a fan. I did not like it at all. But it has definetley grown on me as time has passed on.</p>

                <h1>Kickstart my Heart by Mötley Crüe</h1>
                <p>Nothing screams speeding tickets than roaring electic guitars and some sick drums. Thankfully Mötley Crüe has created arguably one of the greatest songs to speed to. Don't take my advice but there are some songs that you can just feel the extra horsepower in your engine and Kickstart my does this perfectly.</p>
