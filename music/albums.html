                <h1>DAMN by Kendrick Lamar</h1>
                <p>There is a reason why DAMN has been on the top 200 charts for the past 375 weeks. It's been on the charst since it's release. DAMN is a great album. It tells the story of Kendrick hacing to come to terms with being rich and famous. It begins with songs like DNA which is him listing every reason why he's so successful. But as the albums gets to the end he has songs like Humble where he is constantly reminding hemsolf to be Humble and not to be wrapped up in the world. But when you play the album is played in reverse you listen to a album about a man who becomes so wrapped up in pride that he eventually ends up dead because of it.</p>
